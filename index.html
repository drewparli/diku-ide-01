<h1>Project 1: Warming up</h1>
<p>Since this is the first project, we'll start off slowly. The idea with this project is to gain some experience with setting up a web-page, and writing <span class="mono">HTML</span>, <span class="mono">CSS</span> and <span class="mono">JavaScript</span>.

You will need a server somewhere to host the files that you will create in the course. We recommend that you use <span class="mono">GitHub Pages</span> for this purpose - this will also make sharing files among group members easier. This page <a class="mono" href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">https://pages.github.com/</a> gives a detailed walk-through of how to set it up (Note that you want to set up a Project site and that you should Start from scratch). If you have another server already set up, you are of course also welcome to use that. If <span class="mono">GitHub</span> is new to you, or if you don't know which editor to use for editing <span class="mono">HTML</span>, <span class="mono">Javascript</span> and <span class="mono">CSS</span> files, please see <a class="mono" href="https://absalon.instructure.com/courses/22192/pages/setting-up-a-github-repository-and-an-editor" target="_blank">Setting up a <span class="mono">GitHub</span> repository and an editor</a>.</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p class="part">Convince yourself that for any number n>1, there exist numbers p and q such that n=3p + 2q.</p>
I am now convinced!

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p class="part">Find a group consisting of 2 or 3 members. Create the group in Absalon.</p>
Our group has yet to be created but will include:
<ul>
  <li>Andrew (qcm239)</li>
  <li>Vik (------)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p class="part">Create an empty <span class=mono>.html</span> page</p>
<p>Done! But as you can see, it is not so <em>empty</em> any more!</p>
<p>We are hosting this project page on <span class="mono">GitHub</span>.</p>

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p class="part">Add a header to the page.</p>
<p> Yeah so, we added a lot of headers to the page. It just looked so lonely with only one header.</p>

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p class="part">Add a style section to the header of the page, and use it to change the color of the header to one of your choosing.</p>
<p> In our style section, we changed the <span class="mono">color</span> attribute in <span class="mono">h1</span>, <span class="mono">h2</span> and <span class="mono">h3</span> to <span class="mono">darkred</span>.</p>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p class="part">Add a small, interesting image to the <span class="mono">.html</span> page.</p>
<a href="https://images.nasa.gov/details-PIA15415.html" target="_blank">
  <img href="" src="https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA15415/PIA15415~orig.jpg">
</a>

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p class="part">Add another small, interesting image to the .html page, but now using only JavaScript (there should be no mention of the image anywhere within the <span class="mono">&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;</span> section.</p>

<div id="addImageHere">
  <script type="text/javascript">
    addImage();
  </script>
</div>

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p class="part">Create a list with links to two interactive visualizations that you've found on the web (not made by you). Describe positive and negative aspects about them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Internet Map (Andrew)</li>
    <a href="https://internet-map.net/" target="_blank">
      <img src="https://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/the-internet-map_50291c551761e_w1500.png">
    </a>
    <p>This is a semantic visualization of the web, meaning that websites are clustered according to their content.</p>
    <p>
    In terms of positive aspects, I would highlight the following three things: 1) the usage of different sized spheres to represent data traffic to each site, 2) the classification of sites by country using color and 3) the positional location of each site on the map being based on the site's link data to other sites. In this case, the use of these 3 aspects creates a visualization that speaks directly to our shared visual image of the universe, where clusters of galaxies are now clusters of websites. I also think that the decision to use a 2D map instead of trying to create a 3D representation makes it easier for a viewer to interact with the available interaction types available with their given browser, i.e. click, zoom and pan.</p>

    <p>In terms of negative aspects, I would say that a viewer needs to read quite a bit of information about the map before being able to fully understand what they are looking at. When the page loads, a very large text box is present with a full page of text to read. A lot of the text could be moved to a different section, as it is just nice-to-know and not relevant to understanding the visualization. Additionally, it is possible to zoom in so far that you get lost in space. Perhaps limiting the amount a viewer can zoom would be helpful, i.e. such that at least one site should be in the viewable area.</p>

    <p>...positives and negatives go here</p>
</ul>

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p class="part">Individual part: For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished (just create a header for each group member on the <span class="mono">.html</span> page). If possible include elements like:</p>

<h3>Andrew</h3>
<p class="part">What type of data would you like to visualize?</p>
<p>I would like to be able to visualize a real-time data stream. Additionally, if the data is geo-location specific, I would like to know how to map the data accordingly. For example, this could minute-by-minute data about the number of passengers entering/exiting a given metro/subway station.</p>

<p class="part">Where would you get access to this data?</p>
<p>As I understand it, there are a number of global organizations pushing for open data among government agencies. Furthermore, there are already a number of governments who either do or have pledged to provide public data openly. Therefore, I would assume that it will be possible in the near future to access numerous real-time data streams from public sources.</p>

<p class="part">What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?</p>
In the case of the transit data I mentioned above, I would want to tell a (neutral) story about what part of the city is currently active. For example, a viewer would be able to see time specific events like the morning and afternoon traffic rush, large sporting or music events, etc. This could be taken a step further if there was access to transit data about arriving and leaving trains along with their passenger capacities, and perhaps scheduled maintenance work. Then there could be a notion of congestion and waiting time associated with the story.

<p class="part">Who is the intended audience?</p>
The intended audience would be the public at large. I think most users of a metro system in a large metropolitan area would be interested in seeing the current state of the cities transit system. Kind of like checking the weather, just transit weather.
