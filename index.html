<h1>Project 1: Warming up</h1>
<p>Since this is the first project, we'll start off slowly. The idea with this project is to gain some experience with setting up a web-page, and writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You will need a server somewhere to host the files that you will create in the course. We recommend that you use GitHub Pages for this purpose - this will also make sharing files among group members easier. This page <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">https://pages.github.com/</a> gives a detailed walk-through of how to set it up (Note that you want to set up a Project site and that you should Start from scratch). If you have another server already set up, you are of course also welcome to use that. If github is new to you, or if you don't know which editor to use for editing HTML, Javascript and CSS files, please see <a href="https://absalon.instructure.com/courses/22192/pages/setting-up-a-github-repository-and-an-editor" target="_blank">Setting up a github repository and an editor</a>.</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
Convince yourself that for any number n>1, there exist numbers p and q such that n=3p + 2q.

<h2>Part 2</h2>
    <li>Find a group consisting of 2 or 3 members. Create the group in Absalon.</li>

<h2>Part 3</h2>
    <li>Create an empty .html page</li>

<h2>Part 4</h2>
    <li>Add a header to the page.</li>

<h2>Part 5</h2>
    <li>Add a style section to the header of the page, and use it to change the color of the header to one of your choosing.</li>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
    <li>Add a small, interesting image to the .html page.</li>

<h2>Part 7</h2>
    <li>Add another small, interesting image to the .html page, but now using only JavaScript (there should be no mention of the image anywhere within the &lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt; section.</li>

<h2>Part 8</h2>
    <li>Create a list with links to two interactive visualizations that you've found on the web (not made by you). Describe positive and negative aspects about them.</li>

<h2>Part 9</h2>
    <li>Individual part: For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished (just create a header for each group member on the .html page). If possible include elements like:</li>

<h3>What type of data would you like to visualize?</h3>
<h3>Where would you get access to this data?</h3>

<!--
    <ol>
        <li>What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?</li>
        <li>Who is the intended audience?</li>
        <li>A sketch/mockup of the visualization.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
