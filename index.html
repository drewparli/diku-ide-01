    <li>Convince yourself that for any number n>1, there exist numbers p and q such that n=3p + 2q.</li>
    <li>Find a group consisting of 2 or 3 members. Create the group in Absalon.</li>
    <li>Create an empty .html page</li>
    <li>Add a header to the page.</li>
    <li>Add a style section to the header of the page, and use it to change the color of the header to one of your choosing.</li>
    <li>Add a small, interesting image to the .html page.</li>
    <li>Add another small, interesting image to the .html page, but now using only JavaScript (there should be no mention of the image anywhere within the <body>...</body> section.</li>
    <li>Create a list with links to two interactive visualizations that you've found on the web (not made by you). Describe positive and negative aspects about them.</li>
    <li>Individual part: For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished (just create a header for each group member on the .html page). If possible include elements like:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>What type of data would you like to visualize, and where would you get access to this data?</li>
        <li>What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?</li>
        <li>Who is the intended audience?</li>
        <li>A sketch/mockup of the visualization.</li>
